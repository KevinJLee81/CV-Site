- Built an App with React, Next.js, DaisyUI, Tailwind CSS, and TypeScript.
- Designed a CloudFront distribution with origin access control, and invalidations.
- Created custom error pages for 403 and 404 error codes.
- The distribution has an S3 origin and uses a SSL/TLS certificate issued by ACM.
- Used Route 53 to manage domain name servers, create records, and validate certificates.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
